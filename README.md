## About me
My name is Maggie Kelly. I am a seinor student-athlete at Lehigh University studying psychology with a minor in mass communication. Currently I am taking part in COMM 165 Data Storytelling summer session where I hope to learn more about the importance of data and how it can be communicated and interpreted.
